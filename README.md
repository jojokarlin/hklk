#The Letters of Harold and Lenore Karlin

This repository represents the ITP independent study digital edition of the letters of Harold and Lenore Karlin using Jekyll and Github. 

##About:##

In 1945, letters mattered more. When transportation was slower and more expensive, and telecommunications were less reliable, human correspondence relied on postage and matter moving across time and space. Add to these general concerns the pressures of war, the translocating force of armed troops. Levels of language and time unfold in the daily letters written between a Jewish couple at the outset of their marriage, 26 year old Lenore Karlin, Womenâ€™s Army Corps (WAC) volunteer and new mother, and 27 year old Harold Karlin, an army doctor stationed in Germany. What is the best way to present this archive? What stories of war, systems of language, and concerns of culture exist in the months they wrote? By creating a way to distribute these contents that simulates the materiality and temporality of this exchange, I present a wartime experience of correspondence.

In Lives in Letters, I propose to create a basis for a digital edition of the letters of Lenore and Harold Karlin. The project will build parameters of the archive to establish a fluidly readable text. The initial version will involve five to ten letters that can be read online via desktop or tablet. The contents and pages will be made open access with code available on Github and content available through CUNY Academic Works. Ideally, the edition will prove a resource for readers curious about the content, to scholars invested in the epistolary mode of communication, and to editors wishing to develop their own digital editions. Ultimately, I would like to use this initial start-up phase to develop a model for digital letter editions that could expand to make a platform for individual users to upload and curate their own personal letter collections. The grant would facilitate the construction of a minimum viable prototype, as well as the investigation of current models and consultation with other letter collectors.
